title: Minu's First Birthday
---

Me, my wife and our daughter Minu celebrated our daughter's first birthday on
8th July with our friends from IU and IUPUI. 

[Kalani](https://www.facebook.com/kalanir), [Bimalee](https://www.facebook.com/bimalee) akka and [Samitha](https://www.facebook.com/samitha.h.liyanage) made a awesome birthday cake with the help from [Saliya](https://www.facebook.com/esaliya) and [Thilina](https://www.facebook.com/thilina.gunarathne) ayya. Thank you everyone for all the help.
