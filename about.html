<p>Before coming to Indiana University, I worked at <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2 Inc.</a> as the product manager for WSO2 Business Process Server. Joining with WSO2 is the best decision I have ever made in my professional life and WSO2 is like home away from home to me.</p>
<p>I'm a committer for 	<a href="http://ode.apache.org">Apache ODE</a>, <a href="http://axis.apache.org/">Apache Axis2/Java</a>, <a href="http://axis.apache.org/">Apache Axis2/C</a> and <a href="http://axis.apache.org/">Apache Rampart/C</a> projects. My research interests are in the areas of SOA, BPM, Distributed and Parallel Computing and Programming languages.</p>
