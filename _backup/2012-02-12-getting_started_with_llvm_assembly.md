LLVM Assembly is a [Static Single Assignment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form)(SSA) based language representation which is used as the common code represenation throughtout all phases of the [LLVM](http://llvm.org) compilaiton strategy. This tutorial explains how to convert function written in C language to LLVM assembly while describing some basic constructs in LLVM Assembly.

## What is LLVM?
LLVM is a compiler infrastructure project which consists of several
modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies.
